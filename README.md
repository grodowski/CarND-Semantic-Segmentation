# Semantic Segmentation

The solution uses the pretrained VGG network with 1x1 convolutions and two skip layers, as suggested by the project setup.

Segmentation results:

![sample2](sample2.png)
![sample3](sample3.png)
![sample4](sample4.png)
![sample5](sample5.png)
![sample6](sample6.png)
![sample7](sample7.png)

Future `TODO`s that weren't completed due to time constraints:

- optimise the model, tune hyperparameters, add regularization
- test the segmentation on own road images
- complete optional tasks
- add a mIoU metric

### Introduction
In this project, you'll label the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).

### Setup
##### Frameworks and Packages
Make sure you have the following is installed:
 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
##### Dataset
Download the [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip).  Extract the dataset in the `data` folder.  This will create the folder `data_road` with all the training a test images.

### Start
##### Implement
Implement the code in the `main.py` module indicated by the "TODO" comments.
The comments indicated with "OPTIONAL" tag are not required to complete.
##### Run
Run the following command to run the project:
```
python main.py
```
**Note** If running this in Jupyter Notebook system messages, such as those regarding test status, may appear in the terminal rather than the notebook.

### Submission
1. Ensure you've passed all the unit tests.
2. Ensure you pass all points on [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/989/view).
3. Submit the following in a zip file.
 - `helper.py`
 - `main.py`
 - `project_tests.py`
 - Newest inference images from `runs` folder  (**all images from the most recent run**)
